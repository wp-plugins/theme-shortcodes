== Description ==
A collection of all handy theme related shortcodes, provided as a plugin so as to be theme agnostic.
This plugin is a work in progress and as such cannot be relied upon for production use at this time due to fluctuations in CSS class names.
The aim here is to aggregate all the wordpress shortcodes in one location using the best practices for performance.
Please help out by testing the plugin and reporting bugs on the github issue queue.

I will be documenting each shortcode at http://onemanonelaptop.com/docs as time allows.

Here are some of the shortcodes currently defined
'chart','esc','adsense','map','comment-published','comment-author','comment-edit-link','comment-reply-link','comment-permalink','comment-count','category-group-posts','post-title-link','post-title','post-author-link','post-author','post-terms','post-comments-link','post-published','post-edit-link','post-shortlink','post-url','post-date','post-cats','post-tags','post-views','page-nav'
